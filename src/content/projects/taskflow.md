TaskFlow is a comprehensive project management solution designed for modern teams. Built from the ground up with performance and user experience in mind.

## The Challenge

Teams need a tool that's both powerful and easy to use. Existing solutions were either too complex or lacked essential features.

## Key Features

### Kanban Boards

Visualize your workflow with customizable kanban boards. Drag and drop tasks, set priorities, and track progress in real-time.

### Real-time Collaboration

See changes as they happen. Multiple team members can work on the same board simultaneously without conflicts.

### Analytics Dashboard

Gain insights into your team's performance with detailed analytics. Track velocity, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.

### Integrations

Connect with your favorite tools:

- GitHub/GitLab for issue tracking
- Slack for notifications
- Calendar apps for deadlines

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, efficient state
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live updates
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: JWT with refresh tokens

## Lessons Learned

Building TaskFlow taught me valuable lessons about:

1. Handling real-time data synchronization
2. Designing intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces
3. Scaling WebSocket connections
4. Creating accessible, keyboard-navigable UIs

## Results

- 50+ active teams using the platform
- 99.9% uptime since launch
- Average response time under 100ms
